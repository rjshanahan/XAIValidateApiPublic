XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:\r\n         1. \"Detect and Position\" or \"declare and verify\": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.\r\n           \r\n          \r\n        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:\r\n        \r\n          | Function | Description |\r\n          |-----|-----| \r\n          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product. XAI Validate currently supports up to two applicants.|\r\n          | `ExternalDataId`| This is the reference information for your existing data aggregator. XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|\r\n          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|\r\n          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a \"declare and verify\" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `\"IsActualsOnly\": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' \"declared\" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|\r\n          \r\n        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. The table below describes the supported data sources and the request specifics. Depending on your XAI Validate client setup you will be able to use two data sources by  default - your chosen data aggregator and the connect your own data options:\r\n            \r\n            \r\n          | Data Source | `DataProviderName` | `DataProviderReference` | Details |\r\n          |-----|-----|-----|-----|\r\n          | illion ODS BrokerFlow | `ODS` | A list of your BrokerFlow `DocumentIds`| You can provide multiple `DocumentIds` for each applicant. |\r\n          | illion ODS MultiBank (coming soon!)| `ODSSCV` | None | When your customers link their accounts, their data will automatically synch with your XAI Validate application. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.1 | `YOD11` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.0 | `YOD` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Basiq (coming soon!) | `BSQ` | As list of your Basiq customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Basiq customer identifier. |\r\n          | Connect your own data | `EXT` | None | By selecting `EXT` you will be required to upload your data to the application.

								"description": "        This endpoint allows you to create an \"application\", which is the object that holds all elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer. XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:\r\n         1. \"Detect and Position\" or \"declare and verify\": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.\r\n           \r\n          \r\n        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:\r\n        \r\n          | Function | Description |\r\n          |-----|-----| \r\n          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product. XAI Validate currently supports up to two applicants.|\r\n          | `ExternalDataId`| This is the reference information for your existing data aggregator. XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|\r\n          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|\r\n          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a \"declare and verify\" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `\"IsActualsOnly\": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' \"declared\" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|\r\n          \r\n        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. The table below describes the supported data sources and the request specifics. Depending on your XAI Validate client setup you will be able to use two data sources by  default - your chosen data aggregator and the connect your own data options:\r\n            \r\n            \r\n          | Data Source | `DataProviderName` | `DataProviderReference` | Details |\r\n          |-----|-----|-----|-----|\r\n          | illion ODS BrokerFlow | `ODS` | A list of your BrokerFlow `DocumentIds`| You can provide multiple `DocumentIds` for each applicant. |\r\n          | illion ODS MultiBank (coming soon!)| `ODSSCV` | None | When your customers link their accounts, their data will automatically synch with your XAI Validate application. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.1 | `YOD11` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.0 | `YOD` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Basiq (coming soon!) | `BSQ` | As list of your Basiq customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Basiq customer identifier. |\r\n          | Connect your own data | `EXT` | None | By selecting `EXT` you will be required to upload your data to the application.

								"description": "        This endpoint allows you to create an \"application\", which is the object that holds all elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer. XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:\r\n         1. \"Detect and Position\" or \"declare and verify\": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.\r\n           \r\n          \r\n        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:\r\n        \r\n          | Function | Description |\r\n          |-----|-----| \r\n          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product.

XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|\r\n          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|\r\n          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a \"declare and verify\" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `\"IsActualsOnly\": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' \"declared\" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|\r\n          \r\n        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources.

								"description": "        This endpoint allows you to get serviceability metrics for your applications. By passing the `ApplicationReferenceNumber` for an existing application you can use the validated financials from earlier [`/application/create`](#Application/Create) and [`/application/manage`](#Application/Manage) requests to get accurate serviceability outputs.\r\n        \r\n        In each request you can provide a list of new facilities, for which serviceability metrics will be returned. \r\n          \r\n        You will be required to supply the following required information:\r\n          * `ApplicationReferenceNumber`: this will extract validated financials from the application object from earlier processes.\r\n          * `NewFacilities`: specifics of the new debt facilities.\r\n          * `ConfigurationSet`: the lending policy configuration for which you wish to calculate serviceability metrics. This will be the lender or product enumeration you have configured within XAI Validate\r\n\r\n        If you require HEM calculations you can set the `IsHemRequired` optional parameter. This is set to `false` by default. If you set this value to `true` then you must provide the following additional values under the `ApplicationContacts` object:\r\n          * `EmailAddress`\r\n          * `Dependants`\r\n          * `MartialStatus`\r\n          * `ResidentialStatus`\r\n  \r\n\r\n        You also have the ability to provide additional applicant and application level values over and above the outputs from earlier financial validation processes. These are optional - we will use validated figures and configured defaults where these are not provided. The table below lists the high level optional objects for tailoring serviceability calculations.\r\n          \r\n          | Optional Value | Purpose |\r\n          |-----|-----|        \r\n          | `ApplicantIncome` | Applicant-specific income values including self-employed income inputs and addbacks.|\r\n          | `ApplicantDebt` | Applicant-specific liabilities including home loans and ownership percentage |\r\n          | `ApplicationExpenses` | Household-specific expenses include non-discretionary expenses and HEM values |\r\n           \r\n        Please note:  \r\n          * If your applicant is self employed you will need to set the `IsSelfEmployed` parameter within the `ApplicationContact` to `true`. This value is `false` by default.\r\n          * If your applicant has a HECS debt you will need to set the `HasHecsDebt` parameter within the `ApplicationContact` to `true`. This value is `false` by default.\r\n        "

If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources.

This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data.

XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:\r\n         1. \"Detect and Position\" or \"declare and verify\": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources.

XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|\r\n          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|\r\n          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a \"declare and verify\" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response.

If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources.

By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data.

This is ideal if you've sourced your own raw transaction data from core systems or through Open Banking.\r\n          \r\n        This option will be available if you have have provided the `\"DataProviderName\": \"EXT\"` value to either [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create) or [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoints.\r\n          \r\n        There are four steps to linking your own data to your applicants. \r\n          1. create your application through [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create). You'll need to set the following value in the request - `\"DataProviderName\": \"EXT\"`\r\n          2. call this endpoint with a `POST` method and  your `ApplicationReferenceNumber` and a list of `ApplicationContacts` you wish to load data against.\r\n          3. the response will return a one-time URL for each applicant in your request.\r\n          4. call the one-time URL returned above with a `PUT` method, providing the account and transaction data in the body in the format shown in . You'll need to call this endpoint for each applicant.\r\n          \r\n        Once your customers' data has been uploaded the financial validation process will be triggered. You can monitor progress through  [`/financialvalidation/application/getstatus`](#/getFinancialValidationJob) and retrieve results from  [`/financialvalidation/result/getsummary`](#/getResultsSummary)."

								"description": "        This endpoint allows you to create an \"application\", which is the object that holds all elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer. XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:\r\n         1. \"Detect and Position\" or \"declare and verify\": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.\r\n           \r\n          \r\n        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:\r\n        \r\n          | Function | Description |\r\n          |-----|-----| \r\n          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product. XAI Validate currently supports up to two applicants.|\r\n          | `ExternalDataId`| This is the reference information for your existing data aggregator. XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|\r\n          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|\r\n          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a \"declare and verify\" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `\"IsActualsOnly\": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' \"declared\" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|\r\n          \r\n        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. The table below describes the supported data sources and the request specifics. Depending on your XAI Validate client setup you will be able to use two data sources by  default - your chosen data aggregator and the connect your own data options:\r\n            \r\n            \r\n          | Data Source | `DataProviderName` | `DataProviderReference` | Details |\r\n          |-----|-----|-----|-----|\r\n          | illion ODS BrokerFlow | `ODS` | A list of your BrokerFlow `DocumentIds`| You can provide multiple `DocumentIds` for each applicant. |\r\n          | illion ODS MultiBank (coming soon!)| `ODSSCV` | None | When your customers link their accounts, their data will automatically synch with your XAI Validate application. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.1 | `YOD11` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.0 | `YOD` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Basiq (coming soon!) | `BSQ` | As list of your Basiq customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Basiq customer identifier. |\r\n          | Connect your own data | `EXT` | None | By selecting `EXT` you will be required to upload your data to the application.

								"description": "        This endpoint allows you to submit your customers' account and transaction data against an existing application and applicant. This is ideal if you've sourced your own raw transaction data from core systems or through Open Banking.\r\n          \r\n        This option will be available if you have have provided the `\"DataProviderName\": \"EXT\"` value to either [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create) or [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoints.\r\n          \r\n        There are four steps to linking your own data to your applicants. \r\n          1. create your application through [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create). You'll need to set the following value in the request - `\"DataProviderName\": \"EXT\"`\r\n          2. call this endpoint with a `POST` method and  your `ApplicationReferenceNumber` and a list of `ApplicationContacts` you wish to load data against.\r\n          3. the response will return a one-time URL for each applicant in your request.\r\n          4. call the one-time URL returned above with a `PUT` method, providing the account and transaction data in the body in the format shown in . You'll need to call this endpoint for each applicant.\r\n          \r\n        Once your customers' data has been uploaded the financial validation process will be triggered. You can monitor progress through  [`/financialvalidation/application/getstatus`](#/getFinancialValidationJob) and retrieve results from  [`/financialvalidation/result/getsummary`](#/getResultsSummary)."

XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:\r\n         1. \"Detect and Position\" or \"declare and verify\": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a \"declare and verify\" approach you need to provide your customers' \"declared\" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.\r\n         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.\r\n         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.\r\n           \r\n          \r\n        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:\r\n        \r\n          | Function | Description |\r\n          |-----|-----| \r\n          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product. XAI Validate currently supports up to two applicants.|\r\n          | `ExternalDataId`| This is the reference information for your existing data aggregator. XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|\r\n          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|\r\n          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a \"declare and verify\" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' \"declared\" or \"stated\" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' \"actual\" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `\"IsActualsOnly\": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' \"declared\" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|\r\n          \r\n        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. The table below describes the supported data sources and the request specifics. Depending on your XAI Validate client setup you will be able to use two data sources by  default - your chosen data aggregator and the connect your own data options:\r\n            \r\n            \r\n          | Data Source | `DataProviderName` | `DataProviderReference` | Details |\r\n          |-----|-----|-----|-----|\r\n          | illion ODS BrokerFlow | `ODS` | A list of your BrokerFlow `DocumentIds`| You can provide multiple `DocumentIds` for each applicant. |\r\n          | illion ODS MultiBank (coming soon!)| `ODSSCV` | None | When your customers link their accounts, their data will automatically synch with your XAI Validate application. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.1 | `YOD11` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Yodlee v1.0 | `YOD` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |\r\n          | Basiq (coming soon!) | `BSQ` | As list of your Basiq customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Basiq customer identifier. |\r\n          | Connect your own data | `EXT` | None | By selecting `EXT` you will be required to upload your data to the application.
