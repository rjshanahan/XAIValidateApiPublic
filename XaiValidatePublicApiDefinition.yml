  description:   >-
    ## Welcome to XAI Validate  
      XAI Validate is powered by [Tic:Toc](https://tictoc.ai), a Fintech providing innovative products to make financial services processes faster, smarter and simpler. We provide lenders with AI automation technology to grow their lending volumes without compromising on credit quality.
            
      If you're a lender you can use XAI Validate in two ways:
      - **Detect and Position**: instantly identify income, expenses, assets and liabilities, behavioural and risk insights.
      - **Declare and Verify**: verify customers’ declared financials against the actual financial position identified in the data. Ideal for those who want to configure their credit policy and underwrite by exception.      
        
    ## Data Inputs
      XAI Validate supports a range of data sources including:
      - popular data aggregators
      - connect your own data
      - Consumer Data Right (CDR) - coming soon!
      - XAI Data (OCR) - coming soon!

    ## Getting Started  
      The XAI Validate API allows you to integrate the assessment of financial position into your workflow. The table below provides a summary of endpoints, which allow you to get "data in" and then "data out". You can use the [XAI Validate user interface](https://app.tictoc.ai) at any time to interact with your data and the automated assessment of financial position.
          
      Before you can start using the API there are a few things you will need to do first:
      - Sign-up for XAI Validate. [Contact us](mailto:enterprise@tictoc.ai) to discuss the right product and access to our `sandbox`
      - Your client credentials for the XAI Validate user interface and API. These will be be provided to you by Tic:Toc, and must be stored securely
      - You're then ready to start developing against our test environment using the endpoints below. 

        | Endpoint Name| Description |
        |-----|-----|
        | [`/application/create`](#/financialvalidation/application/create) | Create an application linking your applicants, and their external data aggregator reference identifiers.  |
        | [`/application/manage`](#/financialvalidation/application/manage) | Update an existing application including adding "declared/stated" financials, updating applicant details or adding new eexternal data aggregator reference identifiers.  |
        | [`/provideaccounts`](#/financialvalidation/provideaccounts) | Connect your customers' account and transaction data against an existing application and applicant. This is ideal if you've sourced your own raw transaction data from core systems or through Open Banking.  |
        | [`/application/getstatus`](#/application/getstatus) |  Monitor the progress of automated financial assessment.  |
        | [`/result/getsummary`](#/result/getsummary)| Retrieve the results of automated financial assessment. The endpoint will surface automated assessments against your configured credit policy (where relevant), and validation figures for income, expenses, assets and liabilities. |
        | [`/serviceability/getserviceability`](#/serviceability/getserviceability)| Calculate serviceability for your application including income, expense, debt, borrowing amount and ratios. |
        | [`/token`](#/token) | XAI Validate uses OAuth2 authentication. Every time you call these endpoints you'll need to ensure you have a valid token.  |
          
    ## Data Model  
      When you interact with the XAI Validate user interface and APIs you'll notice there's a clear structure to the data. We've designed the XAI Validate data model to be optimised for automating assessment of financial position. The data hierarchy is:
      - **application**: this is the structure that holds all other elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer
      - **applicants**: an application can have one or more applicants (currently limited to two). Applicants can belong to multiple applications, e.g. a customer applying for a credit card and a home loan would exist in two applications
      - **households**: your applicants belong to households. For convenience, we will assign applicants to a single, default household at the start of the the application
      - **accounts**: applicants own accounts, which can be held individually or jointly with the other  applicant on the application
      - **transactions**: these are the credits and debits against each account. Transactions are enriched with attributes such as categories, high-risk flags, and expense management. 
          
    ## Resources
      Here are a few resources to help you on your way:
      - **User guide**: you can access this through the XAI Validate application with the in-app contextual help.
      - **Postman 'Collection'**: <a href="https://github.com/TicTocHomeLoans/XAIValidateApiPublic/raw/main/XAI%20Validate%20API%20Collection.postman_collection.json" target="_blank">download the Postman Collection here</a> to help you interact with the XAI Validate API.
      - **SDK**: coming soon!

        description: Production authorisation server
      description: >-
        Before you can call the XAI Validate endpoints, you need to authenticate via the `/token` API. Successful authentication will return a token that can then be used to authorise your access to functional APIs. You'll need to include this token in the `Authorization` header in your calls.
          
        The `/token` API URL includes values in the query path. The URL will look like this:        
          `https://{host}/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials`

        The `host` value will either be `auth.tictoc.ai` for production or `auth.stage.tictoc.ai` for testing.

        You'll also need to include information in your headers:
          - `Authorization`: Base64 encoded `client_id` and `client_secret` provided to you by the XAI Validate team as part of onboarding. The format is: `"Basic {client_id}:{client_secret}"`
          - `Content-Type`: the value is `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`

        **Remember, your API credentials must be kept safe and secure. Do not share these or publish to publicly accessible locations such as your client-side code or GitHub.**

      - Application
      summary: Create an application with up to two applicants and their external data aggregator references.
      description:  >-
        This endpoint allows you to create an "application", which is the object that holds all elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer. XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.
          
          
        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:
         1. "Detect and Position" or "Verify and Decision": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a "Verify and Decision" approach you need to provide your customers' "declared" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.
         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.
         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.
           
          
        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:
        
          | Function | Description |
          |-----|-----| 
          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product. XAI Validate currently supports up to two applicants.|
          | `ExternalDataId`| This is the reference information for your existing data aggregator. XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|
          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|
          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a "verify and decision" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' "declared" or "stated" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' "actual" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `"IsActualsOnly": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' "declared" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|
          | `Lender`| This optional parameter can be used to drive the credit policy against which you would like your application assessed. The code will be defined as part of your onboarding process. |
          
          
        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. The table below describes the supported data sources and the request specifics. Depending on your XAI Validate client setup you will be able to use two data sources by  default - your chosen data aggregator and the connect your own data options:

          | illion ODS MultiBank (coming soon!)| `ODSSCV` | None | When your customers link their accounts, their data will automatically synch with your XAI Validate application. |
          | Yodlee v1.1 | `YOD11` | As list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |
          | Basiq (coming soon!) | `BSQ` | As list of your Basiq customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Basiq customer identifier. |
          | Connect your own data | `EXT` | None | By selecting `EXT` you will be required to upload your data to the application. Please see [`/financialvalidation/provideaccounts`](#/financialvalidation/provideaccounts) for more information. |

          | Link additional data source to an application |This is useful when your applicants provide additional bank account information thorugh your data aggregator, and you need to rerun the automated assessment. Please see the table below for data source details. |
          | Add/edit applicants within an application| Add new applicants or edit existing ones. |
          
        When you call the endpoint, automated assessment will commence once you receive a successful response. You can monitor the progress using the [`/application/getstatus`](#/application/getstatus) endpoint or by subscribing the status update webhook.
          
        Please note the assessment levels XAI Validate currently supports for providing "stated/declared" financials. These have been designed in line with lending best practices:
          
          | Assessment Level | Financial Types |
          |-----|-----|
          | `Application` | These are application-level financials (`DeclaredFinancialsApplication`) and currently accommodate  `AssetsCash` for assessment of your applicants' deposit|
          | `Household` | Your applicants will belong to `Households` and the `DeclaredFinancialsHousehold` object currently supports `ExpensesMonthly` for your applicants' household's monthly expenses |
          | `Applicant` | These are the applicant-specific financials, which includes a `IncomeSalary` figure, a list of `IncomeRental` values,  a list of `LiabilitiesHomeLoans` values, and single values for `LiabilitiesCreditCard*` and `LiabilitiesPersonalLoan*`|

      description:  >-
    
        This endpoint allows you to submit your customers' account and transaction data against an existing application and applicant. This is ideal if you've sourced your own raw transaction data from core systems or through Open Banking.
          
        This option will be available if you have have provided the `"DataProviderName": "EXT"` value to either [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create) or [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoints.
          
        There are four steps to linking your own data to your applicants. 
          1. create your application through [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create). You'll need to set the following value in the request - `"DataProviderName": "EXT"`
          2. call this endpoint with a `POST` method and  your `ApplicationReferenceNumber` and a list of `ApplicationContacts` you wish to load data against.
          3. the response will return a one-time URL for each applicant in your request.
          4. call the one-time URL returned above with a `PUT` method, providing the account and transaction data in the body in the format shown in . You'll need to call this endpoint for each applicant.
          
        Once your customers' data has been uploaded the financial validation process will be triggered. You can monitor progress through  [`/financialvalidation/application/getstatus`](#/getFinancialValidationJob) and retrieve results from  [`/financialvalidation/result/getsummary`](#/getResultsSummary).

        position.
      description: >-
      
        This endpoint includes the automated assessment of financial position results. It reflects the automated assessment, and any of your users' interaction with the data in the XAI Validare UI. Using this endpoint you'll be able to retrieve a comprehensive assessment of your applicants' income, expenses, assets, liabilities and any behavioural flags such as high risk transactions or arrears events.
          
        The table below summarises the key objects returned:
          
          | Object | Description |
          |-----|-----|   
          | `AssessmentSummary` | This list of objects is tailored to those clients undertaking "declare and verify" financial assessment. Each object in the list will align to a client-specific credit policy setting, including an automated decision outcome, the applicant's "declared" financials, the "actual" financials found by XAI Validate and any "reviewed" financials from your users' interaction with the XAI Validate user interface.|
          | `ApplicationResults` | This object includes the results for application-specific automated assessments, specifically your applicants' total asset position (i.e. deposit).|
          | `HouseholdResults` | This object includes key descriptive statistics from the XAI Validate assessment of household-specific expenses including non-discretionary, discretionary and any removed expenses. |
          | `ApplicationContactResults` | This object contains detailed information about the XAI Validate assessment of your applicants' financial position. Individual objects will be returned for income (salary, rental and other), home loans, credit cards and personal loans. |

      summary: Retrieve a summary of actual expenses by your configured assessment category
        position.
      description: >-
      
        This endpoint provides you with a breakdown of expenses by household and category. The expense categories will align to your own custom categories, where configured. If none are configured we will return expense summary by the LIXI Living Expense aligned XAI Validate "assessment category".
          
        You can retrieve the expense summary by passing through the `ApplicationReferenceNumber` returned when you created your application. The response body will summarise expenses by household and category, including:
          - Non-discretionary expenses: the total value, volume, count and share of expenses deemed to be non-discretionary
          - Discretionary expenses: the total value, volume, count and share of expenses deemed to be discretionary
          - Removed expenses: the total value, volume, count and share of expenses removed from the expense assessment process
          - Totals: the date range, total volume and value

      description: >-
        Retrieve the status of your automated financial assessment process. Financial validation has a diverse range of activities from retrieving provider data, normalising accounts and transactions, through to automated assessment of financial position. A `GroupId` will be returned in the response for the following endpoints, which you can use to monitor progress:
          - [`/application/create`](#/application/create)
          - [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage)
          
          We will return an overall status of the financial validation tasks. The status codes are:
          - `READY` - task processing has not yet started 
          - `PROCESSING` - task processing is underway
          - `COMPLETED` - task processing has completed successfully
          - `FAILED` - a task has failed processing. XAI Validate will retry the task, so continue to monitor.
          - `DEAD` - oops... something's gone wrong. No further processing takes place - we'll monitor the system for these issues.

      summary: Subscribe to notifications about the processing status of financial validation tasks.
      description: >-
        Use this webhook to subscribe to notifications about the processing status of key stages of the financial validation process. You can define your callback URL inside the XAI Admin user interface or by getting in touch with your account manager.
          
        The webhook will provide updates on progress for the following stages:
          - `Commenced`: the financial validation process has started. Tied to when you call the [`/application/create`](#/application/create) and [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoints
          - `Data`: the data retrieval and normalisation process has completed
          - `Categorised`: the categorisation stage of data enrichment has complected
          - `Expenses`: the automated expense assessment process has completed
          - `Income`:  the automated income assessment process has completed
          - `Liabilities`: the automated customer liabilities assessment process has completed
          - `Assets`: the automated customer assets assessment process has completed
          - `Serviceability`: where enabled, the serviceability results using "declared" financials are ready
          - `Finalised`: the entire financial validation process has completed

        For each notification a status will be returned:
          - `COMPLETED` - task processing has completed successfully
          - `DEAD` - oops... something's gone wrong. No further processing takes place - we'll monitor the system for these issues.

      summary: Get serviceability metrics for an application and its applicants.
      description:  >-
        
        This endpoint allows you to get serviceability metrics for your applications. By passing the `ApplicationReferenceNumber` for an existing application you can use the validated financials from earlier [`/application/create`](#Application/Create) and [`/application/manage`](#Application/Manage) requests to get accurate serviceability outputs.
        
        In each request you can provide a list of new facilities, for which serviceability metrics will be returned. 
          
        You will be required to supply the following required information:
          * `ApplicationReferenceNumber`: this will extract validated financials from the application object from earlier processes.
          * `NewFacilities`: specifics of the new debt facilities.
          * `ConfigurationSet`: the lending policy configuration for which you wish to calculate serviceability metrics. This will be the lender or product enumeration you have configured within XAI Validate

        If you require HEM calculations you can set the `IsHemRequired` optional parameter. This is set to `false` by default. If you set this value to `true` then you must provide the following additional values under the `ApplicationContacts` object:
          * `EmailAddress`
          * `Dependants`
          * `MartialStatus`
          * `ResidentialStatus`
  

        You also have the ability to provide additional applicant and application level values over and above the outputs from earlier financial validation processes. These are optional - we will use validated figures and configured defaults where these are not provided. The table below lists the high level optional objects for tailoring serviceability calculations.
          
          | Optional Value | Purpose |
          |-----|-----|        
          | `ApplicantIncome` | Applicant-specific income values including self-employed income inputs and addbacks.|
          | `ApplicantDebt` | Applicant-specific liabilities including home loans and ownership percentage |
          | `ApplicationExpenses` | Household-specific expenses include non-discretionary expenses and HEM values |
           
        Please note:  
          * If your applicant is self employed you will need to set the `IsSelfEmployed` parameter within the `ApplicationContact` to `true`. This value is `false` by default.
          * If your applicant has a HECS debt you will need to set the `HasHecsDebt` parameter within the `ApplicationContact` to `true`. This value is `false` by default.

      description:  >-
        This endpoint allows you to create one or many test applications for your own internal testing purposes. The applications will be created in a "demonstration" client, ringfenced from your main applications. Key features include:
          
          1. automatic incrementing of dates relative the application creation date  
          2. use default account/transaction data or provide your own  
          3. choice of validation approaches.  
          
        
        The following parameters are required:
        
          | Parameter | Description |
          |-----|-----| 
          | `DemoApplicationsRequired` | The number of test applications to create.|
          | `IsStatedAndActual`| Boolean to indicate whether you want a "declare and verify" approach to validation (`true`) or "detect and position" (`false`).|
          | `CreateJointApplication`| Boolean to indicate whether you want a single or joint test application.|

        You can optionally provide the following request parameters:
        
          | Parameter | Description |
          |-----|-----| 
          | `ProvideAccounts` | Boolean as to whether you want to provide your own data or use the standard test data provided by XAI Validate. The default is `false`. If you specify `true` the response payload will include unqiue URLs against which you can `PUT` your own data. Please see [`/financialvalidation/provideaccounts`](#/manageAccountTransaction)|
          | `Lender`| Specify the lender code configured against your account to drive the validation use one of your credit policies.|

        The response will include your the `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (`Arn`) of your test application. If you specify `"ProvideAccounts": true` in the request, the response will also include the unique URL against which you can `PUT` your data (see  [`/financialvalidation/provideaccounts`](#/manageAccountTransaction)).
